<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The system can automatically discover any supported EnGenius EWS Series Access Points connected to the network with a simple click of a mouse, self-configure and become instantly manageable. Simply log into the device via any standard web browser and assign APs into cluster groups. Wireless radio, wireless security and other wireless related configurations can all be easily applied to multiple APs simultaneously, eliminating the time consuming process of configuring each and every Wireless Access Points individually. The user friendly GUI provides instant access to a variety of client and network information including Managed AP List, Auto Discovered AP List, Cluster Grouping List, and Client List with complete MAC/IP Address, Incoming/Outgoing Traffic, Wireless Output Power and other relevant information. Statistics of AP and client traffics are automatically generated into easy-to-understand graphs, providing a visual representation of the network traffic. Not to forget the Topology View feature that allows administrators to quickly see the whole wired/wireless network topology at real-time for easier planning, troubleshooting and monitoring, as well as Floor Plan View and Map View which allows for quickly locating deployed APs, a helpful feature for large scale AP deployment and multi-site management. There’s also an Intelligent Diagnostics feature for administrators to check the status of Wireless APs and provide easy troubleshooting for offline units and even capable of rebooting APs remotely.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The Wireless Management Switch comes fully packed with advanced wireless networking features including Band Steering, Fast Handover, Fast Roaming, Mesh Network, Guest Network and SSL Certificate Management. Wireless Band Steering automatically directs 5GHz-compatible clients to a 5GHz band to ease traffic congestion on the 2.4GHz band, improving capacity, throughput, and the experience for users in crowded bandwidth-intensive wireless networks. Fast Roaming and Fast Handover allow mobile users to roam between different APs and seamlessly maintain an uninterrupted connection for latency-sensitive voice and video applications. SSL Certificate Management enables users to easily setup a self-signed SSL Certificate for securing data transfer between the Wireless Management Switch and Wireless APs, providing a robust security fence for your wireless network.</span></p>
